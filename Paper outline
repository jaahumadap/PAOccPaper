#Lydia's notes from first meeting

PART I 
Examine power of sampling design for detecting changes in occupancy over time
	
Questions:
1)	How many sample sites do we need to detect X% change in occupancy over time?  (e.g. 10, 30, 60, 90, 120)
2)	How many days of sampling do we need to detect X% change in occupancy over time? (e.g. 15, 30, 45, 60)
3)	How does this vary depending on detection probability (e.g. 0.01, 0.05, 0.08, 0.2, 0.5)
4)	How does this vary with the number of years of data (e.g. 3, 10, 20)

Approach:
•	Use “colext” function in unmarked package
•	Simulate data using code in colext vignette / Jorge’s jaahumadap Github account with rare species code.R
•	Run ~100 models to 100 realizations of simulated data for each combination of parameters of interest to generate a distribution
•	Start with one species with one model to explore the number of simulations needed to capture the distribution, then expand.
-       Detect change by doing a logistic regression on the expectations and examine
-       What levels of change (1%, 5%, 10%, 50%)
-       5 levels of sample size * 4 levels of change * 4 levels number of days * 5 levels of detection probabiluity * three levels of number of years = 1200 combinations

PART II
Test sensitivity of WPI to changes in species richness, evenness and occupancy. How many years does it take to detect significant change?

Hold constant the mixtures of rare, moderate and common species for scenarios A and B

A.) Changes in occupancy; Create a distribution of communities; hold constant the number of species at 20 species; vary survival rates (95%, 90%, 85%); run WPI 100 times to get error distribution for each of the following 4 scenarios with each of the survival rates

% increasing: 	0%	0%	0%	33%
	
% stable:	0%	33%	67%	33%	

% decreasing:	100%	67%	33%	33%	

B.) Changes in species richness
1.	Create distribution of communities of 10, 20, 50 and 100 species with stochastic occupancy trends; hold constant 90 CT points and 30 days of sampling; run WPI 100 times to get error distribution
2.	Look for change in % of community eliminated per year (0, 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%); run WPI 100 times for each scenario to get error distribution 
3.	Identify under what conditions the WPI detects a significant change in species richness

C.) Changes in evenness
Evenness can be measured as 1 minus the variance in the occupancies. All species start at the same survival values but species have different rates of change; Keep that process the same, change the number of species and the final evenness
	Use species richness dataset, but fill in missing species by doubling occupancy of a remaining species as each species is lost

Step 1: write code to create a community starting with raw binary data for each species; this would be an extension of data.generator(), which is the underlying function creating a population; give it an input matrix of initial conditions. This will be two separate sets of communities (one for changes in occupancy and the other for changes in species richness and evenness).

PLAN MOVING FORWARD
Lydia will figure out current problems ASAP definitely by 4/29
Jorge will write community simulator code by end of Friday 4/29
Plan for meeting on 4/29 at 5 pm
Next, Jorge will work on species richness simulator, Lydia will work on occupancy simulator/scenario
Aim to meet again to talk 5/13; if Jorge has time before conferences can start working on evenness
